Text Edit for Android
By Paul Mach (paulmach at gmail.com)

SUMMARY

Simple notepad app to open, edit and save text files to and from the SD card.

** Some features
-- open email attachments
-- change font size, type and color
-- delete/rename in file browser
-- email as text or attachment
-- Search using "search" button
-- Typewriter sound effect

NOTES

This app currently does everything I need it do. Minus some bug fixes, this is 
probably it for Text Edit. There's nothing more I care to add.

This app has been open sourced as a little gift to the open source community 
that I've used and abused for over a decade. Thank you.
